# DSA_CODE_Progress_every_week
# WEEK (1) :

# In the first week I learnt how to use git and github in a good way and also solved questions related to it.

# WEEK (2) :

# In this week I learnt about the bits and the bitwise operators and their importance in the field of Data structures and algorithm.
# I also got to knew about the use of recursive functions.

# WEEK (3) :

# Though I knew arrays from the previous knowledge of mine but for the sake better understanding of the sorting of the arrays, I studied it again. So, ultimately
# I completed week 3 also.

# Sorry due to settlement in the campus and due to midsem I am not able to complete the week 4 and week 5. I hope I will do it soon.
